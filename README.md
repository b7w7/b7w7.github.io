## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/b7w7/b7w7.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/b7w7/b7w7.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)
Skeleton is a simple, responsive boilerplate to kickstart any responsive project.

Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

There are a couple ways to download Skeleton:
- [Download the zip](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton/releases/download/2.0.4/Skeleton-2.0.4.zip)
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton.git` (Note: this is under active development, so if you're looking for stable and safe, use the zipped download)


### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS as a reset, a sample favicon, and an index.html as a starting point.

```
Skeleton/
├── index.html
├── css/
│   ├── normalize.min.css
│   └── skeleton.css
└── images/
    └── favicon.ico

```

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more.
- Around 400 lines of CSS unminified and with comments
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.

## Extensions

The following are extensions to Skeleton built by the community. They are not officially supported, but all have been tested and are compatible with v2.0 (exact release noted):
- [Skeleton on LESS](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-less): Skeleton built with LESS for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries. (Last update was to match v2.0.1)
- [Skeleton on Sass](https://github.com/whatsnewsaes/Skeleton-Sass): Skeleton built with Sass for easier replacement of grid, color, and media queries. (Last update was to match v2.0.1)
